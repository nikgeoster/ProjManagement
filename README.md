# ProjManagement
Create an object model for a project management application. 

1.       A project can be managed as a set of tasks performed by users utilizing resources in some amount of time adhering to a schedule. 

2.       The object model should contain the classes, the attributes, methods and events on those classes 

3.       The code should be well commented to inform the design decisions taken in defining the classes. 

4.       It should be hosted on Github (public/private with access provided to us) with proper meaningful incremental commits.  

5.       Do not commit the whole code in one commit. We would like to observe your thought process while designing the solution and the evolution of the code. 

6.       The code should compile without any errors. 

7.       Add a README file with the use cases that your model will support 

8.       Using the classes you have created, write the necessary code in the appropriate classes to perform the following. Assuming 

    a.       each task has an amount of time it takes to complete 

    b.       it may have a dependency on some other task to be completed first 

    c.       It may require a user/resource of some specific type 

Write a function to verify if a project can be completed by a given date assuming the project is started today.
